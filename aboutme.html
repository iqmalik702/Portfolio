 <h1> Circuit Boards </h1>
 <p> Today we started our unit on Robotics. Although they taught us the basics, it was still pretty cool. We stuck different materials into the breadboard and made 2 LED lights light up.

<h2>We started using Javascript today!</h2>
<p> We had the chance to touch upon a different programming language called JavaScript, which could also be used for HTML and web design/construction. It's pretty cool so far. Here's an example of what I can do: </p>
<button type="button"
onclick="this.innerHTML = 'Blue'">Click me for my favorite color!</button>
                        
                                                                       
<p id="demo"></p>
